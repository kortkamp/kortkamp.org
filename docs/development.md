About commit 4325f5e, the project started using *conventional commits* convention. Currently the project is mainteined by just one person, but that was not a excuse to not use good practices on commiting. Besides, from time to time I gonna need to spend some days on another projects and as you already know, a week away makes our projects seems new to us.
3bbd242, following good practices, I started using *ESLint* with Airbnb Style. I cant say I didint feels the impact. Since start of my studies in Web Development, I've made my own style, but now completely agree that a Code is writen not to computer, but to others programmer.
